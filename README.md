# SAS-Example-for-Sample-Size

Two groups of eight cows were fed tawo different diets (A and B) in order to test the difference in milk yield.

Determine the sample sizes required to find the samples means significantly different with power of 0.80 and level of significance α = 0.05.

# Output explanation
In order for the difference between the two sample means to be significant with α = 0.05 level of significance and power of 0.80, the required sizes for each sample are at least 16 and 21 for one- and two-sided tests, respectively.
